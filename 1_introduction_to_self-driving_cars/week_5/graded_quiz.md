Mass-Spring-Damper System. What is the **correct transfer function** for this closed loop?

    - Transformation function 4
    
* You are given the step response of a few different PID controllers using the same gains for the same first order 
transfer function. **Determine a possible set of controllers** that generated these step responses:

    - 1st response by PD; 2nd response by PID; 3rd response by PI
    
* What is the output of a typical output of a Longitudinal control module? (Select all that apply)

    - Throttle angle

* The results of a simulation of the control response to a step change in desired speed of a dynamic vehicle 
model with a PID controller are shown in the figures below. There are two spikes on these figures: 
one spike is between 2 and 3 seconds, another spike is between 3 and 4 seconds. **What is the reason of these spikes?**

* A vehicle is being operated on a highway with the reference velocity of 126 km/h (35 m/s) in gear 4 and 
it overcomes the total load torque of 300 ft-lb. This vehicle specification includes effective wheel radius 
of 0.35 m and 4th gear ratio of 2. **What throttle angle** is required for maintaining the the current speed 
of the vehicle? Please use the below engine map for your computation.
