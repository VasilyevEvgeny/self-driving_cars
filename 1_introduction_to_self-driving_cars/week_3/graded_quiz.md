* According to the report by Rand Corporation, autonomous driving of 8.8 billion miles is required to demonstrate 
human-level fatality rate of an autonomous vehicle fleet using a 95% Confidence Interval. **How many years** is required 
to perform this testing with a fleet of 100 vehicles running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at an average of 25 miles

    - 402
    
* Given that an autonomous vehicle failure has happened and based on this tree, **what is the probability** that the failure 
happened because of Vehicle Control Algorithm Failure OR Inadequate Car Drivers? Please give your answer with the 
precision of 3 decimal places.

    - 0.382
    
* Given that the autonomous vehicle failure has happened, and based on this tree, **what is the probability** that the 
failure happened because of Software Failure AND Extreme Weather Conditions at the same time? Please give your answer 
with the precision of 3 decimal places. Please use the probabilistic fault tree from the previous question for your 
computation:

    - 0.001
    
* A computer vision algorithm is responsible for extracting meaningful data from the onboard camera. A computer vision
 failure restricts the vehicle's ability to navigate the environment around it, hence a problem with this system is a 
 serious failure. However, LiDAR and radar sense similar environment data, so a computer vision failure does not leave 
 the vehicle completely blind. A Computer vision algorithm failure can be considered a somewhat severe failure as it 
 decreases vehicle sensing ability and it gets a severity score of 5. This could happen regularly in low light 
 situations, hence the occurrence number is assigned 4. Computer vision algorithm failure is fairly detectable in 
 majority of the situations, so the detectability score is 3. **What is the risk priority number for a Computer vision 
 algorithm failure** according to FMEA and based on the description above? Your answer should be an integer.
 
    - 60
    
* There are failures listed below. Which failures should we focus on **solving first** according to FMEA?

    - Vehicle driving onto a grael road (risk priority score 400)
    
* Which of the following options is the most **ACCURATE** and **COMPLETE** definition of **functional safety** in terms of 
self-driving vehicles?

    - Functional safety is the detection of a potential dangerous condition resulting in the activation of a
    protective or corrective device or mechanism to prevent hazardous events arising or providing mitigation to reduce
    the consequence othe hazardous event
    
* Which of the following standards defines functional safety terms and activities for electrical and electronic systems 
within motor vehicles?

    - ISO 26262
