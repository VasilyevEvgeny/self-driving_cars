* What are the differences between **exteroceptive** sensors and **proprioceptive** sensors? 
(Select all that apply)

    - Proprioceptive sensors do not interact with the environment, whereas exterioseptive sensors do
    - Exterioceptive sensors can determine obstacle size and distance away, whereas proprioceptive 
 sensors cannot
 
* Which of the following exteroceptive sensors would you use in **harsh sunlight**?

    - Sonar
    - Radar
    
* Why is synchronization and timing accuracy important in the self driving system? **Choose the 
primary reason**.

    - Synchronization is important to ensure the correct sensor fusion
    
* Your autonomous vehicle is driving on the German autobahn at 150 km/h and you wish to maintain 
safe following distances with other vehicles. Assuming a safe following distance of 2s, **what is 
the distance (in m) required between vehicles**? Round your answer to **2 decimal places**.

    - 83.33
    
* Using the same speed of 150 km/h, **what is the braking distance (in m) required for emergency stops**? Assume an 
aggressive deceleration of 5 m/s^2. Round your answer to **2 decimal places**.

    - 173.61
    
* Suppose your vehicle was using long range cameras for sensing forward distance, but it is now nighttime and the 
images captured are too dark. **Which of the following sensors can be used to compensate**?

    - Lidar
    - Radar
    
* What are the differences between an **occupancy grid** and a **localization map**? (Select all that apply)

    - The localization map is primarily used to estimate the vehicle position, whereas the
    occupancy grid is primarily used to plan collision free paths
    - An occupancy grid uses a dense representation of the environment, whereas a localization map
    doesn't need to be dense
    
* The vehicle steps through the software architecture and arrives at the controller stage. What information is required 
for the **controller** to output its commands to the vehicle? 

    - Planned paths
    - Vehicle state
    
* What is (are) the role(s) of the **system supervisor**? (Select all that apply)

    - To ensure that the maps update at the correct frequencies
    - To ensure that the sensors are working correctly
    
* Which of the following tasks should be assigned to the **local planner**?

    - Planning to avoid a parked car in the vehicle's ego
    
* What common objects in the environment appear in the **occupancy grid**?

    - Parked vehicles
    
* Which of the following maps contain **roadway speed limits**?

    - Detailed roadmap
