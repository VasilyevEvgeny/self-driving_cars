* Scenario 1: You’re at home and need to drive to work. During the trip, you will be performing OEDR tasks.
Of the tasks below, which of the following is not an example of OEDR?

    - Maintaning a distance to a vehicle ahead

* Which of the following tasks are associated with perception?

    - Identifying road signs
    - Estimating the motion of other vehicles

* Before leaving, you decide to check the weather. The forecast states that over the next few days there will be both
sun and rain along with some fog. Assuming your vehicle exhibits Level 5 autonomy, which of the following weather
conditions can your vehicle operate?

    - All of the above

* You enter your autonomous vehicle and it drives your usual route to work. While the vehicle is driving, you decide
to take a nap. For which levels of autonomy is this safe? (Select all that apply)

    - 4
    - 5

* Scenario 2: (Assume the car is driving on the right-hand side of the road) . You’re approaching an all ways stop sign
and you want to make a right turn. Your vehicle is denoted in orange. There are 2 pedestrians currently crossing and
another vehicle (denoted in green) approaching the stop sign from the left. This task involves multiple considerations,
which of them are predictive planning? Select all that apply.

    - The green car arrives at the stop sign after you and plans to travel straight through the intersection. You
    choose to move first.
    - Wait for the pedestrians to finish crossing before turning

* Here are some rules for driving at a stop sign. Which of the following is an appropriate priority ranking?

    1). For non all-way stop signs, stop at a point where you can see oncoming traffic without blocking the intersection

    2). If there are pedestrians crossing, stop until they have crossed

    3). If you reach a stop sign before another vehicle, you should move first if safe

    - 2, 1, 3
    
* Which of the following are off-road objects? (Select all that apply)

    - Stop signs
    - Curbs
    - Trees
    
* Suppose your vehicle has lane keeping assistance, which of these objects are relevant for its performance? 
(Select all that apply)

    - Road markings
    - Curbs

* Which of the following sensors are used for the lane keeping assistance? (Select all that apply)

    - GPS
    - LIDAR
    - IMU
    - Cameras
    
* Scenario 3: You are on the highway and you see a truck in front of you. Assume the car is driving on the right-hand 
side of the road. There is also a blue car beside the truck in the other lane. Your vehicle follows the truck and 
maintains a constant distance away. What kind of control is this?

    - Longitudinal
    
* You decide to change lanes to pass a truck. What kind of decision is this?

    - Short term planning
    
* Which of the following tasks are rule-based planning? (Select all that apply)

    - If there are vehicles directly besides us on the lane, it is unsafe to lane change 
    - During a lane change, maintain our current speed or accelerate slightly
    
* Suppose the blue vehicle suddenly brakes and you decide to abort the lane change. If your vehicle can respond 
automatically and remain in its own lane, what is the minimum level of autonomy of your vehicle? 

    - 3
    
* The blue vehicle returns to normal speed and you can now safely change lanes. Your car is performing the lane change, 
what kind of control is this?

    - Lateral
    
* Scenario 4: You are almost at work but encounter a construction site. Assume the car is driving on the right-hand 
side of the road. Your vehicle is denoted in orange. You see a construction site where the workers are repaving a road 
full of potholes. They are using jackhammers which can cause dust clouds. You create the following 
decision tree for getting through the construction site. From the diagram, which of the following 
decisions should you make? (green is true, red is false)

    - B (False)
    - C (True)
    - E (True)
    
* Here are a set of rules for making these decisions, arrange them in an appropriate prioritization.

    1). If there are no vehicles ahead, accelerate to the speed limit

    2). Drive slowly in construction zones

    3). If there are pedestrians or workers directly ahead in the current lane, stop

    4). Yield to merging vehicles, if necessary
    
    - 3, 4, 2, 1
    
* Scenario 5: You’re finished work and need to drive back home, but it’s nighttime. You plan a new path home on your 
GPS application to avoid the construction site, what type of planning is this?

    - Long-term planning
    
* Your new path goes through a school zone and you see the school zone sign. You decide to slow down despite there 
being no pedestrians or children (it’s nighttime). What sort of planning is this?

    - Rule-based planning
